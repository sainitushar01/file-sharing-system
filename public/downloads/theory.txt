node js is js runtime env built on v8 engine .
similar to chrome, node js also trasfers js code to 
v8 engine and recieves output from it. To use js on 
server side to make servers, cli, app backends .

we are using same javascript, but the along with 
libraries and features of node.

node js uses an event-driven non blocking io model that 
makes it lightweight and efficient.
node package ecosystem npm is largest ecosystem of 
open source libraries.


async in node has allowed us to do perform non blocking io, 
if some piece of code is taking time, other code can execute 
in meantime.

Asynchronous ->


When some nodejs async function is written, it gets to call 
stack then from call stack it goes to node api as it will be 
performing some web task, after completion of task, it will be
 added to callback queue and the items in callback queue will 
 only be executed if and only if call stack is empty. As the 
 callstack gets empty the items of callback queue will be executed 
 in event loop.
